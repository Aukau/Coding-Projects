# Coding Projects Repository
This repository contains a section of my public projects that I have used to further my understanding of Quantum Computing, AI, and surrounding topics.

## Purpose
The purpose of these projects is to give others an idea of some areas to pursue if they are following similar paths. On top of this, it serves as a catalogue of my skills as a researcher at the intersection of Quantum Computing + AI.

## Access
This code is free for all users to pull, if you want to use it you should provide relavent citation for any type of inclusion.

## Current Project List
Below I provide a list of the current projects along with short descriptions of what each of them achieve.
### Classical Shadow Tomography | Status: In Progress üõ†Ô∏è
This project explores efficient quantum state property estimation using classical shadows, with both standard post-processing and an experimental LLM-assisted approach to predict observables directly from shadow data.
### Gradient Methods QML | Status: Incomplete üõ†Ô∏è
This project is a study of gradient methods in quantum optimisation algorithms for machine learning. Included is a variational quantum classifier which will be used with several benchmark gradient methods to study what methods work best for different tasks.
### Machine Learning | Status: Complete ‚úÖ
This folder contains a set of machine learning projects to understand basic machine learning structure in professional development. Several projects ranging from basic linear regression to more complex image processing tasks.
### Neural Network From Scratch (NNFS) | Status: Complete ‚úÖ
This project contains all working files for a neural network from scratch. The aim of this was to understand the deep structure of convolutional neural networks to further my deep learning studies. Further work in deep learning can be found with my work on the ToSSim project located at my home page.
### Quantum Generative Adversarial Network | Status: Complete ‚úÖ
The qGAN project was a short study on how we can use quantum-classical hybrid models to deeper understand quantum state structure specifically for QFT states. The results of the study are included in graph format. This study took the deep model structure from [Zoufal et al. (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-019-0223-2), further details are included in the notes section of the jupyter file.
### Quantum Sudoku Solver | Status: Complete ‚úÖ
The Quantum Sudoku Solver was a proof of concept project that was used to learn image processing techniques as well as ising hamiltonian structuring for variational quantum algorithms. As quantum computers are not error-free this is still a proof of concept and will be implemented in full once we have solved that issue.
### Transformer From Scratch | Status: Complete ‚úÖ
Similar to the NNFS project, this project aimed to create a basic transformer from scratch while including a modular mask that users can edit easily. The motivation behind this was based on a study from Mistral in which they trained their model on a unique mask. If we can test out different masks to see what works best for training, then we can better understand how vLLMs learn on tokenized information.
