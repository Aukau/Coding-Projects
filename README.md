# Coding Projects Repository
This repository contains a section of my public projects that I have used to further my understanding of Quantum Computing, AI, and surrounding topics.

## Purpose
The purpose of these projects is to give others an idea of some areas to pursue if they are following similar paths. On top of this, it serves as a catalogue of my skills as a researcher at the intersection of Quantum Computing + AI.

## Access
This code is free for all users to pull, if you want to use it you should provide relavent citation for any type of inclusion.
