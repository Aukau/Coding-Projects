This is the folder for my quantum generative adversarial network based off the paper in Nature (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-019-0223-2).
My final product implements quite a number of modifications to improve the runtime, efficiency, and quality of the qGAN model. The details of the 
changes are listed in the complete version. If this code is of any help to you, feel free to use it, shoot me an email of thanks or whatever you feel
like (zachary@scott-murphy.com) :) this code is open-source, so it is free for anyone to use.
