# Gradient Methods in Quantum Machine Learning
This is a research project to study the different gradient methods in Quantum Machine Learning (QML). The results of this research project are supposed to help researchers identify best case usage for the gradient method depending on tehir Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) project.
## Problem
The problem that this project aims to solve is the variable choice of correct gradient method for any VQA project. Researchers should look over results and pick their preferred method depending on the task at hand.
