# 🧠 ShadowPredictor: Learning Partial Measurement Outcomes from Classical Shadows

## 🎯 Project Goal

This project explores the use of language models (LLMs) to predict partial measurement outcomes from compressed representations of quantum states known as **classical shadows**.

The core idea is to train a transformer-based model on pairs of:
- **Input**: Classical shadow vectors (e.g., generated from random Clifford measurements)
- **Target**: Partial measurement outcomes (bitstrings or distributions)

By learning this mapping, we hope to demonstrate:
- That LLMs can generalize over families of quantum states given partial state information
- A potential new hybrid method for quantum state reconstruction or verification

## 🧪 Method Overview

> 📝 To be filled in with technical implementation details as the project evolves

1. **Data Generation**  
   - Generate target quantum states (e.g., Bell, GHZ, QFT)
   - Simulate classical shadows from these states
   - Extract corresponding partial measurement outcomes

2. **Model Architecture**  
   - Preprocess classical shadows as token sequences or vectors
   - Train a language model (e.g., GPT-style or custom transformer)
   - Predict most likely bitstring measurement outcomes

3. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Accuracy of predicted bitstrings
   - KL divergence from true measurement distribution
   - Generalization to unseen states
